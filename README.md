# My MP3 Downloader

Mainly used to download a youtube playlist into a local directory  as mp3 files. I strongly dislike that other sources have songs hidden or locked away. Since youtube has most songs I chose to make a tool that downloads songs from there locally to use on my phone and personal computer.


## Pre-requisite

To get this to work you will need one component and that is `yt-dlp`. Download this through your computers package manager and then you should be able to run the script

## Running the script

To run the script you will need to run the command as follows:
`python3 mp3Downloader.py --path <Playlist Directory Name> --playlist <Playlist Link>`

Since this script is based off of another python project, here is the link to that one for reference.
